        Why build offline support?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Increasingly, the growth in internet traffic comes from mobile-first and (in some cases), mobile-only connections. This growth often occurs in regions where internet connectivity is sparse, expensive, or just unreliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        As application developers, we want to ensure a good user experience, preventing network shortcomings from affecting applications. With service workers we now have a way to build offline support. Service workers provide an in-browser, programmable network proxy, so that users can always get to something on your website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Service workers provide many new features to web applications, including programmatic file caching, intercepting network request, and receiving push messages. The service worker runs independently of the web app and can even be called when the app isn't running (for example to wake it up and deliver a message).
